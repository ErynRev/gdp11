Code used for our GDP on minimising noises from a Drone

This is mainly for our Synchrophasing setup

Please use commit messages when pushing your commits so it is easier to see what is changed.


Theres a few files that I have added, these are files i stole from the internet for the current encoders that we are using to then test the rpm sensors.

May need to adjust these more than i already have
